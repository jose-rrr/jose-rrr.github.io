I find it hard to believe how many computers were compromised using USB drives. I wonder what devices were plugged into the computers via USB drive that had this malware because I doubt it was just hard drives because I remember how in the hacking google segment for the red team they did something similar with the plasma globes. Hence, I imagine it was similar to that tactic.
